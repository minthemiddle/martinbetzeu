<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
    I love to hear your stories, feedback and ideas to everything I create. The limited time I can put aside I like to dedicate fully to creating high quality articles and products. I hence have clear priorities and do spend all of my available time right now on the following mission:</p>

    <blockquote>
        I help solo entrepreneurs to make the most of their working days. My focus is on solo developer.
    </blockquote>

<p>
    If you have feedback, an offer, opportunity, or introduction that is connected to my priorities or anything that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me:
</p>
<p>
    <span id="cntct-contact"></span>
</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, Iâ€™ll only respond to those e-mails that are a good match for my priorities and schedule.</p>
