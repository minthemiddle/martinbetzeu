<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
    I love to hear your stories, feedback and ideas to everything I create. The limited time I can put aside I like to dedicate fully to creating high quality articles and products. I hence have clear priorities and do spend all of my available time right now on the following:</p>

<ul class="list-reset">
    <li><a href="/products/soloheroes">SoloHeroes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you have feedback, an offer, opportunity, or introduction that is connected to my priorities or anything that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me: <br>
    <span id="cntct"></span>
</p>
<p>For the reasons stated above, Iâ€™ll only respond to those e-mails that are a good match for my priorities and schedule.</p>
