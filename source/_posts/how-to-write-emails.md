Writing good emails is the key competency in any job in my opinion. Here is my checklist on how to craft good emails and one example.

- Make it **scannable**.
-  **Lead with** your **ask**.
- **Establish** your credibility.
- Propose **next steps**.
- Give a **deadline**.
- **If** asking a **question**, **propose a solution**.
- Write your **subject lines like article headlines**.
- **Preview** all messages **on your smartphone**.
- **Edit** all your emails. Never use the first draft.

What are your tipps for writing emails that get results? Contact me via the link below!

Disclaimer: A lot of these tips come from the book [Writing Without Bullshit](https://withoutbullshit.com/book) that I tweak to my language and experience.

# Headline type subject
Title: Cooperation on article on crafting emails?

Dear Peter,

# Lead with the ask
do you want to cooperate with me on an article on writing good emails?

# Establish credibility
I have been writing 10+ high-ranking articles on crafting emails in magazines such as GQ (link) and Harper's Bazaar (link) and got hundreds of positive responses from readers. I think that your magazine could profit from my expertise.

# Propose next steps
If you give me your "okay" for considering the idea, I can send you an outline within 4 working days.

# Give a **deadline**
Could you please send me a "yes" or "no" by Monday, 02, so we both can move forward?

Best
Martin
