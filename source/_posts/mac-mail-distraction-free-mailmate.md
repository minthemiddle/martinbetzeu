Email can eat up all your attention or can be a power tool to purposefully connect with your world. Having a sensitive setup will help you with the latter.

I use Mailmate, a powerfull customizable client. Here are my tipps for

- Disable autosync for all your accounts
  - Right-click on sources
  - `Synchronize schedule > Manual`
- Select an empty folder before quitting the application
  - Mailmate will open with the last selected folder
  - I created a search folder that never returns a result with the criteria: `From > contains > RANDOMLONGSTRING`
  I named this folder ðŸ™‚
- Disable all counters
  - Select all folder > Right-click > `Count > None`
  - Select all sources > Right-click > `Count > None`
